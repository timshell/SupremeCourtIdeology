What to Do:
- Edit CSV to show only data I need
- Load data into Case class
- Consider following questions:
	1. How many times was the case split 9-0 (ideal) or 8-1 / 7-2 (Is this still good?)
	2. For 6-3 splits, were the 3 on party lines?
	3. For 5-4 splits, was the 5 a bloc?
	4. For 4-4 splits (both of which Kagan recused herself), did they fall under bloc lines?
	5. What exactly can we claim about 'ideologicial loyalty' about SCOTUS Justices?
- Future: Develop model to show progression of ideological stance (check Wikipedia article for previous research)

Notes: The two 4-4 cases were excluded from the dataset.

What to Do:
- Edit CSV to show only data I need
- Load data into Case class
- Consider following questions:
	1. How many times was the case split 9-0 (ideal) or 8-1 / 7-2 (Is this still good?)
	2. For 6-3 splits, were the 3 on party lines?
	3. For 5-4 splits, was the 5 a bloc?
	4. For 4-4 splits (both of which Kagan recused herself), did they fall under bloc lines?
	5. What exactly can we claim about 'ideologicial loyalty' about SCOTUS Justices?
	6. Was the majority on the 'liberal' or 'conservative' view? Did there seem to be any difference for unanimous decisions vs. close decisions?
	7. Use Noll-Scully method to compare ideal vs. actual (liberal vs. conservative)
- Future: Develop model to show progression of ideological stance (check Wikipedia article for previous research)
- Future: Can you use transcripts to predict judges vote?
